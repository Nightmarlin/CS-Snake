# C# - Snake
## By Lewis W. Miller

A nice and friendly game of good old Snake, now with added OOPs.  
Not even the sneks are safe from me.

> Programmed in C# using VS17.  
Uploaded to GitHub with the help of GitKraken because I don't like command lines.  
OOP: Object Orientated Programming, not an accident for once
